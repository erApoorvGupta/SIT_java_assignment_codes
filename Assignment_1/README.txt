Question:-
Part1: Implement a menu-driven Java program (like fib or factorial) to implement these input methods in java (command line args, Scanner, BufferedReader, DataInputStream, Console )

Part2: Implement a simple menu driven calculator in java to implement add, sub, mul, div, sqrt, power, mean, variance. Implement a separate Calculator class to include all related function inside that class. (mean calculation : program reads numbers from the keyboard, summing them in the process until the user enters the string “end”. It then stops input & displays the avg. of numbers)


The Main class takes console inputs and the input option class takes all input types such as scanner, bufferedreader, datainputstream.

Calculator does the following funtions:-
1. Addition        
2. Subtraction     
3. Multiplication  
4. Division        
5. Square Root     
6. Power
7. Mean
8. Variance
