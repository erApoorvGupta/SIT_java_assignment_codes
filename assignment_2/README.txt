Problem:-
Part1: Write a Java program that declares two arrays named ‘even’ and ‘odd’. Accept numbers from the user and move them to respective arrays depending on whether they are even or odd.
Part2: Implement a java function that finds 2 neighboring numbers in an array with the smallest distance to each. The function should return the index of the 1st number.
Part 3: Write a Java program to convert an array into ArrayList and vice versa.


Solution:-

Created 3 classes for each part:
1) Takes 10 numbers as input and gives sorted arrays as outputs.

2) Takes 10 numbers as inputs and finds smallest distance, returns the numbers and index of the first number

3) Converts array into aaraylist and vice versa.
